      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        You might be able to claim a significant tax deduction for the business
        use of your space. If you're working from the comfort of your own home,
        whether that's a cozy apartment, a sprawling house, or even a unique
        living space like a boat, you might be able to save on taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does it take to qualify? Whether you're storing inventory or using
        a part of your home as an office, there are specific criteria to meet.
        Daycare providers, you're in for some special rules tailored just for
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you qualify, you're ready to calculate your deductions. There are
        two ways to do this: the detailed route of itemizing actual expenses or
        opting for the simplified method, which will save you time and
        paperwork.

      <h2>Qualifying for a Deduction</h2>
      <p>
        To claim deductions for the business use of your home, you must meet
        specific criteria. Normally, common home expenses like mortgage
        interest, real estate taxes, and utilities aren't deductible as business
        expenses. But, if part of your home is used exclusively and regularly
        for business purposes, you may be eligible for deductions. This includes
        using your home as your principal place of business, meeting clients or
        customers, using a separate structure on your property, or using your
        home for storage related to your business.
      </p>
      <p class="bold-font ul-header">
        To qualify for home office deductions, the space must be used:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>Exclusively and regularly as your main place of business</li>
        <li>
          Exclusively and regularly for meeting clients or customers in your
          trade or business
        </li>
        <li>
          For a separate, unattached structure used in connection with your
          business
        </li>
        <li>Regularly for storage of inventory or product samples</li>
        <li>For rental purposes (see Pub. 527)</li>
        <li>As a daycare facility</li>
      </ul>
      <img
        src="../images/irs-p587-figure-a.png"
        class="blog-image image-w100"
        alt="irs p587 figure a"
      />
      <h3 class="bold-font">Exclusive Use Test</h3>
      <p>
        To qualify for the home office deduction under the exclusive use test, a
        specific area of your home must be used only for your trade or business.
        This area could be a room or another defined space, and it doesn't
        require a permanent partition to qualify. However, if the space is used
        for both business and personal activities, it does not meet the
        exclusive use criterion.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you are an attorney using your home den to write legal
        briefs, but your family also uses it for recreation, you cannot claim a
        deduction for its business use.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Exceptions to the Exclusive Use Test</h3>
      <p class="ul-header">
        You can claim home office expenses without meeting the exclusive use
        test if you use part of your home to store inventory or product samples
        for your business. To qualify, you must:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>Operate a wholesale or retail business,</li>
        <li>Store inventory or product samples at home for business use</li>
        <li>Have your home as the sole fixed location of your business,</li>
        <li>Use the storage space regularly,</li>
        <li>Utilize a separately identifiable area suitable for storage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For instance, if you sell mechanic's tools and use half of your basement
        for storage while occasionally using it for personal purposes, you can
        still deduct expenses for this space.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you use part of your home as a daycare facility, the exclusive use
        requirement does not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of these two exceptions, any part of your home used for business
        must pass the exclusive use test to qualify for deductions.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Regular Use Test</h3>
      <p>
        To meet the regular use test, you need to use a designated area of your
        home for business activities on a consistent basis. Using the space
        occasionally is not enough. When determining if your usage qualifies as
        regular, you should assess all relevant facts and circumstances. Regular
        use is key to establishing that part of your home is genuinely dedicated
        to your business activities.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Trade or Business Use Test</h3>
      <p>
        To pass the trade-or-business-use test, you must use a portion of your
        home specifically for your trade or business activities. Simply engaging
        in profit-seeking activities does not qualify unless they are part of an
        established trade or business.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you use a part of your home to read financial
        periodicals and engage in investment-related activities for personal
        investment purposes, and not as a professional broker or dealer, these
        activities do not qualify as a trade or business. Therefore, you cannot
        claim a home office deduction. This test emphasizes the need for the
        space to be used in connection with a genuine business operation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Principal Place of Business Test</h3>
      <p class="ul-header">
        If you operate a trade or business from multiple locations, including
        your home, your home may qualify as your principal place of business
        under certain conditions. To determine if your home office meets this
        criterion, you should evaluate two key factors:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          Relative Importance: Consider the importance of the activities
          performed at your home compared to other locations where you conduct
          business.
        </li>
        <li>
          Time Spent: Assess how much time you spend working from each business
          location.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ul-header">
        Your home office will qualify as your principal place of business if:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          You use it exclusively and regularly for the administrative or
          management tasks of your business.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no other fixed location where you conduct substantial
          administrative or management activities for your business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="bold-font">
        A Home Office for More Than One Trade or Business
      </h3>
      <p>
        Your home office can serve as the principal place of business for more
        than one distinct trade or business. However, it's important to evaluate
        each business activity separately to determine if the office qualifies
        as the principal place of business for each.
      </p>
      <p class="ul-header">
        To qualify for deductions for multiple businesses, it must be used
        exclusively and regularly for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          As the principal place of business for one or more of your trades or
          businesses.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a location to meet or deal with patients, clients, or customers in
          the normal course of your business activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the office is a separate structure on your property, it must be
          used in connection with your trades or businesses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="bold-font">
        Home Office Expenses for Meeting Patients, Clients, or Customers
      </h3>
      <p class="ul-header">
        If your home serves as a place where you meet with patients, clients, or
        customers as part of your business operations, you may be eligible to
        deduct expenses for the part of your home used for these meetings. This
        is possible even if you conduct business activities at another location.
        To qualify for such deductions, you must meet both of the following
        criteria:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          Physical Meetings: You must physically meet with patients, clients, or
          customers in your home.
        </li>
        <li>
          Substantial and Integral Use: The use of your home for these meetings
          must be substantial and integral to the operation of your business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This requirement is typically met by professionals like doctors,
        dentists, attorneys, etc., who maintain offices in their homes
        specifically for these purposes. However, merely using your home for
        occasional meetings or telephone calls does not qualify for home office
        deductions. Importantly, the area used for meetings does not need to be
        your principal place of business, but it must be used exclusively and
        regularly for business meetings.
      </p>
      <!-- Next Section -->
      <h2>Figuring the Deduction</h2>
      <p>
        There are two ways for figuring your home office deduction: the
        simplified method and using actual expenses. You can choose which one to
        use each year meeting applicable requirements.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">
        Using the Actual Expense Method to Calculate Deductions
      </h3>
      <p class="ul-header">
        If the simplified method is not suitable or available for your
        situation, calculate your deduction using actual expenses.
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          Determine the percentage of your home used for business purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculate the actual expenses associated with that portion, such as
          utilities, rent, insurance, and depreciation.
        </li>
        <li>Applying any limitations on the deduction amount.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-font">Part-Year Use</span>: You can only deduct
        expenses for the part of the year your home was used for business. For
        example, if you start using your home for business on July 1, only
        calculate your expenses from July to the end of the year for your
        deduction.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Calculating Deductions for Actual Expenses</h3>
      <p>
        When using actual expenses, you must allocate the costs between personal
        and business use.
      </p>

      <p class="bold-font">Calculating Business Percentage of Home Use</p>
      <p>
        To accurately claim home office deductions, it's essential to determine
        the business percentage of your home. This percentage is based on the
        proportion of your home that is used for business activities and is
        crucial for calculating the deductible portion of home operating
        expenses.
      </p>
      <p class="bold-font">Methods for Determining Business Percentage</p>
      <p>
        Use any reasonable method to determine the business percentage. Here are
        two common approaches:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-font">Area</span>: Calculate the area (l*w) of the
        space then divide it by the total area of your home. For example, a home
        office is 100 square feet (10’ x 10’) and your total home area is 1000
        square feet, your business percentage is 10%.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-font">Room</span>: If the rooms in your home are
        approximately the same size, divide the number of rooms used for
        business by the total number of rooms. For example, you use one room as
        an office and your home has ten rooms, your business percentage is 10%.
      </p>
      <p class="bold-font">Understanding the Limitations</p>
      <p>
        It's important to understand how gross income from your business affects
        the deductible amount of your home office expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-font">Full Deduction Eligibility</span>: If the gross
        income from your home-based business equals or exceeds your total
        business expenses (which include depreciation), you can deduct all your
        business expenses related to the use of your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-font">Deduction Limitations</span>: However, if your
        business's gross income is less than your total business expenses, the
        amount you can deduct for certain home-related expenses may be limited.
      </p>
      <p>First, take the gross income from the business use of your home…</p>
      <p class="ul-header">
        Then subtract the business portion of expenses that you would be allowed
        to deduct regardless of business use:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>Mortgage interest</li>
        <li>Real estate taxes</li>
        <li>
          Casualty losses related to a federally declared disaster (if you
          itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040), or net qualified
          disaster losses if you claim the standard deduction).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ul-header">
        Next, subtract other business expenses that are directly related to your
        business but not to the use of the home itself:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>Business phone expenses</li>
        <li>Office supplies</li>
        <li>Depreciation on business equipment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After subtracting these amounts, the remaining limit is what you can
        claim for otherwise nondeductible home expenses such as utilities,
        insurance, and home depreciation. Depreciation of the home is calculated
        last.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">
        Using the Simplified Method to Calculate Deductions
      </h3>
      <p>
        The simplified method offers an easier way to calculate your home office
        deductions without needing to track and allocate actual expenses. With
        this method, you calculate your deduction by applying a set rate of $5
        per square foot to the area of your home that's used for business. The
        maximum area you can use for this calculation is capped at 300 square
        feet. This straightforward approach minimizes the complexity involved in
        documenting and substantiating your home office expenses.
      </p>
      <p class="bold-font">Implications of Choosing the Simplified Method</p>
      <p class="ul-header">
        When you opt for the simplified method to calculate your home office
        deductions, it streamlines the process but comes with specific
        limitations:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font"
            >Exclusion of Actual Expenses and Depreciation</span
          >: Choosing the simplified method means you cannot deduct actual
          expenses related to the business use of your home, such as utilities,
          repairs, or depreciation. The depreciation deduction for the portion
          of the home used for business is considered zero for the year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Non-Business-Related Expenses</span>: Mortgage
          interest, real estate taxes, and casualty losses should be treated as
          personal expenses under the simplified method. If you rent part of
          your home, these expenses must still be allocated between the rental
          and personal use, which includes the business use calculated using the
          simplified method.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font"
            >No Deduction or Carryover of Disallowed Actual Expenses</span
          >: If you previously used actual expenses for your home office
          deduction and some of that deduction was disallowed, you cannot deduct
          the carried-over amount in the year you choose the simplified method.
          Instead, this disallowed amount must be carried forward to future
          years when you might switch back to using actual expenses for your
          deduction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Switching back to actual expenses in subsequent years requires using the
        appropriate depreciation tables for Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery
        System (MACRS) to calculate depreciation. This approach to home office
        deductions simplifies the process for some but may lead to different
        financial outcomes depending on your specific expenses and business use
        of the home.

      <h2>Recordkeeping</h2>
      <p class="ul-header">
        When it comes to deducting expenses, maintaining thorough and organized
        records is crucial. You are not required to follow a specific
        recordkeeping method, but your records must be detailed enough to verify
        your deductions.
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Proof of Expenses</span>: Preserve all
