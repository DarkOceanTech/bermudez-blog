      <h2>Qualifications and Licenses</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        What kind of credentials do you have?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tax professionals are identified as either certified public accountants
        (CPAs), enrolled agents (EAs) or unenrolled preparers (UPs). CPA is an
        esteemed designation for accountants. The CPA path prepares accountants
        for areas such as audit, tax planning, merger & acquisitions, and
        forensics. An EA is a tax specialist and can represent you legal
        matters. EAs are licensed by the IRS. A UP is one who prepares a return
        but is not required to sign it as permitted by instructions to the
        return or regulations.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">Who are your other clients?</p>
      <p>
        You want to know if the accountant understands the basics of your
        business. You may need someone who is familiar with real estate, and
        instead the accountant has only prepared tax returns for ecommerce
        businesses. If you find out he has never had a client like you before,
        you may still want to give the accountant a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they are businesses like yours, that is a good sign. In asking about
        clients, you can ask about the work schedule and whether he has the
        capacity and resources to support you adequately.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Do you perceive any conflicts of interest?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tax professionals work with multiple firms and hundreds of individuals.
        You may want to check if the firm represents any of your direct
        competition. Inquire as to how conflict is managed.
      </p>
      <h2>Communication and Technology</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">Is there a timely response?</p>
      <p>
        Accounting needs to be done consistently all year. Annual reporting is
        done during the year, most accounting information should be less than 30
        days old. You should have instant access to your information. talk to
        your tax professional or a CPA firm, quickly and easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proficient CPA firm makes it a habit to get back to clients as quickly
        as possible. This can be a suitable time to ask about support and
        “office hours.”
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        In this digital age, what is your policy on returning phone calls?
      </p>
      <p>
        With client portals and text messaging notifications, it is reasonable
        to ask how long you should expect to wait to have a call returned.
        Asking also lets your CPA know you are interested in voice calls.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Who will I be interacting with and do the same people always service my
        account?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, you want the same person to work with - not whoever is
        available. You want to build a relationship and increase the rate of
        success by partnering with your accountant to execute your long-term
        vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tax firms usually assign more than one person to a client. You might not
        care how the “back room” operates, but you want to know if the person
        interviewing is the one you are working with.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        What services do you use to run your business?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask broad questions about business operations. How does the firm get and
        service clients, the staff, and technology choice. If you have a
        concern, address it by asking about computers, communications equipment,
        or cyber security. Find out if they stay current by asking about their
        research methods, record management and cyber threat response.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">Do you consider yourself tech-savvy?</p>
      <p>
        Just because the CPA offers software packages does not mean they know
        how to use them. For this reason, a proficient CPA will help you install
        and set up a set of books and guide you along the way. Ask if they offer
        any kind of software or IT support.
      </p>
      <h2>Services and Support</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        What kind of creative business advice will you offer?
      </p>
      <p>
        Each industry will have its own strategies. A CPA should be able to
        create a customized tax plan and use all available regulations to reduce
        your current tax liability. Beyond preparing tax forms, quarterly
        reviews should be scheduled to ensure books and records are in order.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Are you available outside of the tax season?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tax preparers can be seasonal and available only the first four months
        of the year. Some even close the office until the following “tax
        season.” Make sure your tax professional is available year-round,
        especially if you were looking for consistent tax planning.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Am I paying the right amount of taxes?
      </p>
      <p>
        One of a tax professional's primary functions is to operate with peak
        tax efficiency in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business owners paying too much in taxes is bad for all businesses, a
        proficient CPA will analyze the tax situation. They will review all
        aspects from business entity structure to all legal means to minimize
        and defer tax payments.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Ask yourself: How can the accountant help me make more money?
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial services are an investment, and the answer will help you find
        out if candidates will treat your business like their own. Did they
        prepare for the interview by reviewing financial information you
        provided? Did they make sure you understood the accounting concepts?
        Another return on the investment should be knowledge provided by the
        accountant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of any tax professional is to save you time and money whether
        you are tax planning for the following year or in an IRS audit.
      </p>
      <h2>Billing and Offer Structure</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Will you be charging me for every phone call?
      </p>
      <p>
        What kind of offer do they have? How do they bill? Is it hourly pay as
        you go, different rates based on staff member, or more like a
        subscription or flat monthly charge? After reviewing past tax returns
        and evaluating the attention you will need, a tax professional should
        get you an accurate estimate.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">What is included?</p>
      <p>
        Make sure you know what is included and expectations up front. The tax
        professional should be asking you questions to let you know what needs
        to be included.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        What can I do to help you with your work and keep the cost to a minimum?
      </p>
      <p>
        Effective communication will save much of the accountant's time by
        preparing information beforehand. Your CPA should be willing to
        collaborate with you to balance the workload to reach either a low cost
        or more efficient workflow – you cannot always have both.
