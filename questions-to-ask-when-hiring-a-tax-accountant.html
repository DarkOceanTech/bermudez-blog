              Questions to ask when Hiring a Tax Accountant in 2024
            </h1>
            <p class="blog-summary">
              A small business accountant can be a trusted advisor. To find the
              right person for the job, it may be a good idea to have a series
              of questions to narrow down the search. Although a good accountant
              will know what questions to ask you to see if they can provide the
              level of attention you need.

      <h2>Qualifications and Licenses</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        What kind of credentials do you have?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Tax professionals are usually certified public accountants (CPAs),
        enrolled agents (EAs) or unenrolled preparers.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Who are your other clients? Do you perceive any conflicts of interest?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        CPAs work for dozens of firms and scores and sometimes hundreds of
        individuals. You should inquire if any of your direct competition is
        represented by the firm. If so, inquire as to how this conflict is
        handled.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Imagine this scenario: You hire an accountant based on the assumption he
        understands the basics of your business. Then, you find out he's never
        had a client like you before. Instead, he's only prepared tax forms for
        wealthy individuals who don't own businesses.
      </p>

      <p class="blog-content">
        Avoid this disaster by asking about the accountant's clients. If they
        are businesses like yours, that's a good sign. In asking about clients,
        you will also want to understand the CPA's work schedule and whether he
        has the time and resources to support you adequately.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        A proficient CPA makes it a habit to get back to clients as quickly as
        possible. Phone messages should be replied to the day they are left – or
        no later than the following day.
      </p>
      <h2>Communication and Technology</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">Is timely service delivered?</p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Accounting information can get out of date quickly. Except for annual
        information, most accounting information should be no more than 10-30
        days old. You should be able to access your up-to-date information and
        your CPA quickly and easily.
      </p>

        A proficient CPA makes it a habit to get back to clients as quickly as

        no later than the following day.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">Do you consider yourself tech-savvy?</p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Small business accounting software has made powerful accounting tools
        available to everyone. But these accounting packages (most notably
        QuickBooks) are only as useful as the person who installs and runs the
        application. For this reason, a proficient CPA will help you install and
        set up a set of books, while also requesting them for review.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Who will I be interacting with? What's your policy on returning phone
        calls? Do the same people always service your account?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Ideally the same person should work with you — not whoever is available
        at the time. That way a relationship can be built where the accountant
        and you are comfortable with each other.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Many tax firms assign more than one person to a client's return. You
        probably don't need to know how the “back room” operates, but you want
        to know if the person you're interviewing is the one who will be able to
        answer your questions about your return.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        A common complaint often heard from consumers about their CPAs is about
        long wait for returned phone calls. CPAs aren't famous for their
        communication skills. It's not unreasonable to ask how long you should
        expect to wait to have a call returned. Asking also lets your CPA know
        you do want your calls returned promptly.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Do you conduct your own business and personal affairs in a reasonably
        efficient and sensible way?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Ask questions about the CPA's approach to getting and serving clients,
        the role of staff, the use of technology – including computers,
        communications equipment, and the Internet — as well as ways of keeping
        current, research methods, management of files and records, etc.
      </p>
      <h2>Services and Support</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        How can the accountant help you make more money? Do you believe I'm
        paying too much, too little, or just the right amount of tax?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Beyond simply preparing tax forms, an accountant should be involved in
        business planning throughout the year. Typically, a quarterly review
        should be scheduled to ensure books and records are in order. This also
        allows the CPA time to advise clients about their businesses, so they
        function with peak tax efficiency.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Because most business owners pay too much in taxes, a proficient CPA
        will analyze the tax situation from the form of entity to all legal
        means to plan and minimize all taxes paid.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        It sounds like a wise-guy question, but the answer will help you find
        out if candidates are interested in your business. Did they review the
        financial information you provided prior to the interview? Did they make
        sure you understood the accounting concepts, instead of tossing off a
        bunch of jargon?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        A proficient CPA's goal to save you more in taxes — it is also in his
        best interest that you succeed.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        What kind of creative business advice will you offer me?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Advising clients on what they can do to grow and set goals, as well as
        discussing issues, are all part of a proficient CPA's services.
        Together, this allows you to discover what works for your business, so
        funds are used wisely.
      </p>
      <h2>Billing and Offer Structure</h2>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        Are you available outside of the tax season? How are your fees
        calculated? Will you be charging me for every phone discussion?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        To avoid friction later, it is essential to discuss the CPA's fee
        structure. Tax professionals may bill by the hour, form, overall return,
        or some combination. After reviewing your previous returns and
        interviewing you, a tax professional should be able to give you a good
        faith estimate of costs. If the CPA uses a time-based system, discuss
        the hourly rate of the accountant and staff, overhead expense
        reimbursement (what is the cost of a fax?) and whether certain time is
        not billed.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Find out now whether a simple two-minute phone call or a one-page fax
        means an hour of billable time. If that's the case, run for the door.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Some tax preparers are seasonal. They are available only the first four
        months of the year, or their offices are close for a few months each
        year. If you expect year-round access, you need to make sure the tax
        professional is available.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">
        What can I do to help you with your work and keep your fees to a
        minimum?
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        A great deal of your accountant's time can be saved by preparing
        information beforehand. Find out if your CPA is willing to work with you
        to offload this work to your firm.
