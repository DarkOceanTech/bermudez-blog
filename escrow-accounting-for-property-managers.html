        properly,let's first trace the path the cash takes through your
        business. A third party holds money in an account on behalf of two other
        parties while they complete a transaction. The neutral party may hold
        assets, such as cash, securities, or funds, until both the buyers and
        sellers have fulfilled their responsibilities.

      <p class="blog-content">
        The escrow account manager may be a lender, escrow company, escrow
        agent, or mortgage agency. In real estate transactions, the escrow agent
        or company may be the same as the title company.

        You close on a single family with $3,500 of escrow. This covers $291.66
        per month of property taxes and insurance. Escrow Accounts may either be
        cash that the business expects to receive or cash the business must pay
        out. In this case, the escrow is a prepayment for expenses and is an
        asset. The escrow is for the next 12 months and is a current asset.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        To set up an escrow account in QBO, you can create a Bank or Other
        Current Assets. They have the same effect on your Income Statement and
        Balance Sheet. It comes down to personal preference. Let us use the
        current asset account.

        I opened a session using QBO's Sample Company. Use it to evaluate new
        bookkeeping techniques. Head over to the left side menu and select Chart

        I am not sure of the detail type, so I will just choose Investment -

        As you add more assets to your books, you may need to update the escrow
        account information. Create a system for adding and updating accounts,
        including naming conventions and tax treatment. In this case, I thought
        it would be better to change the Account name to something more
        descriptive by replacing Current with Insurance & Tax. I also decided to
        select Prepaid Expense as the detail type since it is more accurate.

      <h2>Business Activity while Managing Escrow</h2>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Bookkeeping is all about mapping your physical business activity to the
        digital world. The transaction is happening with the lender and the
        escrow account maps the transactions with your lender.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">Escrow is restricted cash</p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Escrow is one form of restricted cash. Any cash reserved for a specific
        purpose qualifies as restricted assets. For example, if you set aside
        revenue to pay dividends to shareholders or expect to lose a lawsuit and
        reserve cash to pay the judgment.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content">
        Although escrow is part of your financials as a cash on hand asset, and
        available to you, you are not supposed to use it for anything other than
        its intended purpose.
