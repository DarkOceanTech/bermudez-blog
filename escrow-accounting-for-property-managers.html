        properly,let's first trace the path the cash takes through your
        business. A third party holds money in an account on behalf of two other
        parties while they complete a transaction. The neutral party may hold
        assets, such as cash, securities, or funds, until both the buyers and
        sellers have fulfilled their responsibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The escrow account manager may be a lender, escrow company, escrow
        agent, or mortgage agency. In real estate transactions, the escrow agent
        or company may be the same as the title company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have the path, let us map your Chart of Accounts using
        QuickBooks Online (QBO).

        You close on a single family with $3,500 of escrow. This covers $291.66
        per month of property taxes and insurance. Escrow Accounts may either be
        cash that the business expects to receive or cash the business must pay
        out. In this case, the escrow is a prepayment for expenses and is an
        asset. The escrow is for the next 12 months and is a current asset.
      </p>
      <p>
        To set up an escrow account in QBO, you can create a Bank or Other
        Current Assets. They have the same effect on your Income Statement and
        Balance Sheet. It comes down to personal preference. Let us use the
        current asset account.
      </p>
      <p>
        I opened a session using QBO's Sample Company. Use it to evaluate new
        bookkeeping techniques. Head over to the left side menu and select Chart
        of Accounts from the Transaction center.

      <p>
        Select the best description for your escrow account. Investment -
        Mortgage/Real Estate Loans and Prepaid Expenses both are suitable
        options. I am not sure of the detail type, so I will just choose
        Investment - Mortgage/Real Estate Loans for now. The escrow is a current
        asset so I will name the account Current Escrow.

      <p>
        Going back to the Chart of Accounts, the Current Escrow account now has
        a $3,500 balance mathcing Journal Entry #1.

      <h2>Add Escrow Payments to Track your Asset</h2>
      <p>
        As you use your escrow, create an expense to match the HUD. The prepaid
        expense asset is now an actual expense reducing your tax liability.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/escrow-series/coa-pay-insur-tax.jpg"
        class="blog-image image-w100"
        alt="Horacio Bermudez"
      />
      <p>
        What's actually happening here? The insurance and rent expense accounts
        are going up. Your available escrow is going down by the amount of the
        expense. The escrow balance is now $3,208.34.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/escrow-series/coa-review-escrow-2.jpg"
        class="blog-image image-w100"
        alt="Horacio Bermudez"
      />
      <p>
        If you enter the account register to see all the transactions, you will
        find the initial journal entry to log the asset and the expense to log
        the escrow payment.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/escrow-series/coa-review-register-1.jpg"
        class="blog-image image-w100"
        alt="Horacio Bermudez"
      />
      <p>
        As you add more assets to your books, you may need to update the escrow
        account information. Create a system for adding and updating accounts,
        including naming conventions and tax treatment.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/escrow-series/coa-edit-button-escrow-account.jpg"
        class="blog-image image-w100"
        alt="Horacio Bermudez"
      />
      <p>
        In this case, I thought it would be better to change the Account name to
        something more descriptive by replacing Current with Insurance & Tax. I
        also decided to select Prepaid Expense as the detail type since it is
        more accurate.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/escrow-series/coa-update-escrow-account.jpg"
        class="blog-image image-w70"
        alt="Horacio Bermudez"
      />
      <p>
        Add another payment for the following month, keeping the reference
        numbering consistent. It makes asset reporting easier.
      </p>
      <img
        src="images/escrow-series/coa-review-register-2.jpg"

      <h2>Business Activity while Managing Escrow</h2>
      <p>
        Bookkeeping is all about mapping your physical business activity to the
        digital world. The transaction is happening between the lender, lessee,
        and leaser. The escrow and the other related accounts map the physical
        activity to QBO.
      </p>
      <p class="blog-content bold-font">Escrow is restricted cash</p>
      <p>
        Escrow is one form of restricted cash. Any cash reserved for a specific
        purpose qualifies as restricted assets. For example, if you set aside
        revenue to pay dividends to shareholders or expect to lose a lawsuit and
        reserve cash to pay the judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although escrow is part of your financials as a cash on hand asset, and
        available to you, you are not supposed to use it for anything other than
        its intended purpose.
