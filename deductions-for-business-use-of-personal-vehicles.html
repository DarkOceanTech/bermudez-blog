      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        While running your business, you can deduct certain transportation
        expenses without having to travel far from home. These deductions cover
        a variety of transportation modes including air, rail, bus, taxi, and
        notably, the use of your personal car. There are several ways to
        qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
        Costs incurred while
        <span class="bold-font"
          >traveling between different work locations</span
        >
        within your tax home area qualify for deductions. Your tax home is the
        city or general area where your business is based. Expenses for
        <span class="bold-font"
          >visiting clients or attending business meetings</span
        >
        away from your regular workplace are deductible. You can deduct expenses
        when
        <span class="bold-font"
          >traveling from your home to a temporary workplace</span
        >, provided you also have one or more regular workplaces. These
        temporary workplaces can be within or outside your tax home area.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you travel overnight, different rules apply, particularly in
        calculating car expenses.

      <h2>When Are Transportation Expenses Deductible?</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-font">Commuting costs</span> are daily expenses of
        driving between home and regular workplaces. Generally, they are not
        deductible but there are some exceptions. Traveling to a temporary
        workplace outside your metropolitan area is deductible. If your home is
        your principal place of business, you can deduct transportation costs
        between your home and another work location in the same trade or
        business, regardless of the work's duration or distance.
      </p>

      />
      <h3 class="bold-font">Temporary Work Location</h3>
      <p class="ul-header">
        If you frequently travel between your home and a temporary work
        location, you might be able to deduct these transportation costs.
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Regular and Temporary Sites</span>: If you
          have one or more regular work locations away from your home and
          commute to a temporary work location in the same trade or business,
          you can deduct daily round-trip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Duration of Employment</span>: A job location
          is temporary if it is expected to last for one year or less.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Change in Duration</span>: If a job initially
          expected to last less than a year extends beyond that, it is still
          temporary until your expectations change. Once it is expected to last
          more than a year, it no longer qualifies as temporary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="bold-font">Overnight Stays</h4>
      <p>
        If the temporary work location is far enough from your regular work area
        that you need to stay overnight, different rules apply. In this case,
        you may be eligible for travel expense deductions.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">No regular place of work</h3>
      <p>
        If you do not have a fixed workplace but usually work within the
        metropolitan area where you reside, you can deduct transportation cost.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font">
        Temporary Work Sites Outside Your Metropolitan Area
      </h4>
      <p>
        You can deduct transportation costs for travel between your home and a
        temporary work location outside your metropolitan area. The metropolitan
        area typically includes the city and its suburbs.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font">Non-Deductible Commuting Expenses</h4>
      <p>
        Daily transportation costs between your home and any temporary work
        sites within your metropolitan area are not deductible. These are
        considered regular commuting expenses and are not eligible for tax
        deductions.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Two places of work</h3>
      <p>
        When your workday involves traveling between two different job
        locations, there are deductions you can take. You can deduct the costs
        of traveling directly from one workplace to another within the same day,
        regardless of whether these locations belong to the same employer. If
        you do not travel directly from one job to the other due to personal
        reasons, you can only deduct the amount it would have cost you to travel
        directly between the two.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font">Non-Deductible Commuting Expenses</h4>
      <p>
        Costs associated with traveling between your home and a part-time job on
        your days off from your main job are considered commuting expenses and
        are not deductible.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Commuting Expenses</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to commuting between your home and your primary workplace,
        certain costs are not deductible. Expenses incurred while taking public
        or driving a car between your home and your main or regular workplace
        are non-deductible. These are personal commuting expenses. This
        non-deductibility applies regardless of the distance between your home
        and your workplace or whether you engage in work-related activities
        during the commute.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font ul-header">Specific Non-Deductible Expenses</h4>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Parking Fees</span>: Costs for parking at your
          place of business
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Advertising Displays on Car</span>: Adding
          business advertisements to your car does not convert the vehicle's use
          from personal to business for tax purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Car Pools</span>: Costs related to
          participating in a non-profit car pool are not deductible. However, if
          you run a car pool for profit, you can deduct car expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Hauling Tools or Instruments</span>: Commuting
          with tools or instruments in your car is not deductible, but costs
          like renting a trailer are deductible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Union Members' Travel</span>: Costs from
          traveling from a union hall to a workplace are non-deductible as your
          employment location is considered your workplace, not the union hall.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Business discussions or phone calls made during these trips do not
        change their classification from personal to business. Only expenses
        directly related to business activities, like visiting clients, are
        deductible.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Office in the home</h3>
      <p>
        If you maintain a qualifying home office that serves as your principal
        place of business, you are eligible to deduct certain travel expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can deduct the transportation costs for travel between your home
        office and another work location within the same trade or business. This
        includes the costs of driving your car or using other modes of
        transportation to get to these other work locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        To determine if your home office qualifies as your principal place of
        business, refer to

      <h2>How to Deduct the Car Expenses</h2>
      <p>
        Business use of your car makes you eligible to deduct car expenses using
        one of two different methods. The
        <span class="bold-font">Standard Mileage Rate</span> allows you to
        deduct a set amount for each mile driven for business purposes. The
        <span class="bold-font">Actual Car Expenses</span> method involves
        deducting the actual costs of operating your car for business, including
        gas, repairs, insurance, and depreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you qualify to use both the standard mileage rate and actual
        expenses, try to calculate your deduction using both methods to see
        which one offers a larger deduction.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font ul-header">Important Changes to Note</h4>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, miscellaneous itemized deductions
          subject to the 2% floor are suspended for tax years beginning after
          December 2017 and before January 2026. This means you can no longer
          claim the cost of using your car as an employee for these expenses as
          a miscellaneous itemized deduction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Exceptions</span>: Certain individuals, such
          as Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, and
          fee-basis state or local government officials, can still deduct
          unreimbursed employee travel expenses directly from their adjusted
          gross income on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Line 12.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Standard Mileage Rate</h3>
      <p>
        The standard mileage rate is an efficient way to calculate deductible
        costs. The rate is 65.5 cents per mile. If you cannot or choose not to
        use the standard mileage rate, you will calculate your car deduction
        using actual expenses.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font ul-header">Key Rules and Restrictions</h4>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Exclusive Use</span>: If you choose the
          standard mileage rate for any year, you cannot claim actual car
          expenses for that year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">First-Year Choice</span>: To use the standard
          mileage rate, you must use this method in the first year your car is
          used for business. In subsequent years, you can switch between
          standard mileage and actual expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Leased Vehicles</span>: For leased vehicles,
          if you choose the standard mileage rate, you must continue to use it
          for the entire lease period.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Standard mileage rate not allowed</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          If you use five or more vehicles simultaneously (like in fleet
          operations).
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have claimed a depreciation deduction using any method other
          than straight-line for the estimated useful life of the car.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you used the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) for
          depreciation.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have claimed a Section 179 deduction, a special depreciation
          allowance, or have claimed actual car expenses after 1997 for a leased
          car.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font">
        Switching from Standard Mileage to Actual Expenses
      </h5>
      <p>
        If you switch to actual expenses after initially using the standard
        mileage rate, you must use straight-line depreciation for the remaining
        estimated life of the vehicle, adhering to specific depreciation limits.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Reimbursements</h5>
      <p>
        If you switch to actual expenses after initially using the standard
        mileage rate, you must use straight-line depreciation for the remaining
        estimated life of the vehicle, adhering to specific depreciation limits.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Car for Hire</h5>
      <p>
        If you switch to actual expenses after initially using the standard
        mileage rate, you must use straight-line depreciation for the remaining
        estimated life of the vehicle, adhering to specific depreciation limits.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Ownership of Multiple Vehicles</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Five or More Cars</span>: If you own or lease
          five or more cars that are used for business simultaneously, you
          cannot use the standard mileage rate for any of them. In this case,
          you would need to calculate your deductions based on actual car
          expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Alternating Vehicle Use</span>: If you
          alternate the use of these cars for business (meaning you do not use
          them at the same time), this rule does not apply, and you may still be
          eligible to use the standard mileage rate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="bold-font">Interest on Car Loans</h4>
      <p>
        If you are self-employed and use your car for business, you can deduct
        the portion of the interest expense that corresponds to the business use
        of the car. For example, if 60% of your car's use is for business, you
        can deduct 60% of the interest expense on Schedule C (Form 1040).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you finance your car purchase through a home equity loan, you might
        be able to deduct the interest. Reference IRS Publication 936, "Home
        Mortgage Interest Deduction," for more details.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font">Personal Property Taxes</h4>
      <p>
        You can deduct the business portion of state and local property taxes
        for motor vehicles.
      </p>
      <h4 class="bold-font">Parking Fees and Tolls</h4>
      <p>
        Business-related parking fees and tolls are deductible, even if you use
        the standard mileage rate. However, parking fees at your regular place

      <h4 class="bold-font">Sale, Trade-in, or Disposal of a Car</h4>
      <p>
        If you sell, trade in, or dispose of your car in any way, you may need
        to calculate gain or loss for the transaction, or adjust the basis of
        your new car.
      </p>
      <h3 class="bold-font">Actual Car Expenses</h3>
      <p>
        If you opt not to use the standard mileage rate, you can deduct the
        actual expenses associated with using your car for business. If your car
        serves both personal and business purposes, you must allocate expenses
        based on usage. For example, if 60% of your driving is for business, you
        can deduct 60% of your total car expenses.

        Continued Deductions for Fully Depreciated Vehicles
      </h4>
      <p>
        Even if your car is fully depreciated, you can continue to deduct other

          <span class="bold-font">Capital Expenses</span>: The cost of the car,
          including sales tax and improvements, typically is not deductible
          immediately but can be depreciated.

      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Standard Vehicle Definition</span>: For
          depreciation, a car includes any four-wheeled vehicle primarily for
          use on public streets with an unloaded gross vehicle weight of 6,000
          pounds or less.
        </li>
        <li>
          This definition excludes vehicles like ambulances or hearses used
          directly in a business, or vehicles used for transporting persons or
          property for pay.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="bold-font">Qualified Nonpersonal Use Vehicles</h4>
      <p>
        Vehicles modified for business (e.g., with permanent shelving or company
        logos) and unlikely to be used for personal purposes, like certain
        delivery trucks, qualify for different depreciative treatment.
      </p>

      <!-- Next Sub-Section -->
      <h4 class="bold-font">Section 179 Deduction</h4>
      <p>
        Section 179 deductions allow businesses to deduct the full purchase
        price of qualifying vehicles and other assets used in a business,
        subject to certain limits.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Eligibility and Limits</h5>
      <p>
        You can elect to deduct the cost of a car that qualifies as Section 179
        property in the year you place it in service. The vehicle must be used
        more than 50% for business to qualify for the Section 179 deduction. If
        it's used less, the benefit might be reduced or eliminated.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Financial Limits</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">2023 Deduction Limit</span>: The maximum
          deduction in 2023 is $1,160,000.

        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Total Investment Limitation</span>: This
          begins to phase out dollar-for-dollar after $2,890,000 of total
          property is placed in service during the tax year, eliminating the
          deduction entirely above $4,050,000.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Specific Vehicle Limit</span>: For certain
          heavy vehicles, including some SUVs primarily designed to carry
          passengers, the deduction is capped at $28,900.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Special Considerations for Vehicles</h5>
      <p class="ul-header">
        If you claim the Section 179 deduction, you must consider the first-year
        depreciation limits, which vary based on when the vehicle was acquired
        and placed in service:
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>$12,200 for vehicles before September 28, 2017</li>
        <li>
          $20,200 after September 27, 2017, unless you do not claim the special
          depreciation allowance, then $12,200.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Electing the Deduction</h5>
      <p>
        The election must be made in the year the car is placed in service. Use
        Form 4562 for depreciation and amortization.

      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Recapture of Deduction</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Business Use Decline</span>: If the business
          use of the vehicle drops to 50% or less in subsequent years, you must
          recapture (reclaim as income) any excess depreciation claimed. This
          includes adjusting for any Section 179 deduction taken.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Recapture Process</span>: This involves
          reporting the recaptured amount as ordinary income in the year the

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Disposing of the Vehicle</h5>
      <p>
        When you dispose of a vehicle on which you've claimed the Section 179
        deduction, the deduction is treated like any other depreciation for
        recapture purposes. Any gain on the sale is considered ordinary income
        up to the amount of the Section 179 deduction plus any allowable
        depreciation.

      <h4 class="bold-font">Leasing a Car</h4>
      <p>
        When leasing a vehicle for business, you can choose between the standard
        mileage rate or actual expenses to calculate your deductible costs.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Deductible Lease Payments</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Business Use</span>: You can deduct the
          portion of each lease payment that corresponds to business use.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Advance Payments</span>: Any upfront payments
          made at the start of the lease must be spread out over the entire
          lease term for deduction purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Inclusion Amounts</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Purpose</span>: For leases of 30 days or more,
          you may need to reduce your lease payment deduction by an inclusion
          amount. This adjustment mirrors what would happen with depreciation
          limits if the vehicle were owned rather than leased.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Calculation</span>: The inclusion amount is
          calculated by taking a portion of the vehicle's fair market value,
          multiplied by the percentage of the vehicle's business use, then
          prorated for the number of days in the tax year.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Fair Market Value</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Definition</span>: This is the price at which
          the vehicle would sell under normal conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Use in Calculations</span>: Determine the fair
          market value on the first day of the lease term; if your lease
          agreement specifies a capitalized cost, use this as the fair market
          value.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Identify the Relevant Appendix</span>:
          Depending on the year the vehicle was placed in service; you will
          refer to a specific IRS appendix that provides inclusion amounts for
          different fair market values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Prorate the Amount</span>: Adjust the
          inclusion amount from the appendix based on the number of days in the
          tax year the lease covers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Apply Business Use Percentage</span>: Multiply
          the prorated amount by the percentage of the vehicle's business use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Examples</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">2023 Lease Example</span>: If you leased a car
          on January 17, 2023, with a fair market value of $62,500 and used it
          75% for business, you would refer to Appendix A-6 and adjust the
          inclusion amounts for each tax year based on usage and days in the
          year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Change in Use Example</span>: If you initially
          leased a vehicle for personal use but later switched to business use
          (like starting a self-employed consulting job), you must reassess the
          fair market value at the time of conversion and calculate inclusion
          amounts accordingly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Reporting Requirements</h5>
      <p>
        Reporting for sole proprietors and farmers should be done through

      <h4 class="bold-font">Disposition of a Car</h4>
      <p>
        When you dispose of a car used for business, consider the various tax
        outcomes selling, trading in, or losing the car to a casualty or theft.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Taxable Gains and Deductible Losses</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Depreciation Recapture</span>: Any gain on the
          sale of the vehicle with depreciation deductions taken in previous
          years is taxed as ordinary income. This includes Section 179
          deduction, clean-fuel vehicle deductions, and special depreciation
          allowances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Casualty or Theft</span>: If the car is
          disposed of due to casualty or theft, and you receive insurance
          proceeds exceeding the car's adjusted basis, you may realize a gain.
          However, if you reinvest the insurance proceeds in similar property
          within a specific time frame, you might not have to recognize this
          gain. The basis of the new property is its cost minus any deferred
          gain.

      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Publication 544</span>: For detailed guidance
          on how to report the disposition of a car, refer to IRS Publication
          544, which covers sales and other dispositions of assets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Like-Kind Exchanges</span>: For exchanges
          completed after December 31, 2017, like-kind exchanges are generally
          limited to real property not held primarily for sale. When you trade
          in your car for another car, typically no gain or loss is recognized
          if the exchange qualifies as like-kind.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Depreciation Adjustment</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Standard Mileage Rate</span>: If you used the
          standard mileage rate to deduct car expenses, depreciation is included
          in that rate. You must adjust the basis of your car by the amount of
          depreciation factored into the standard mileage rate over the years of
          usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Actual Expense Method</span>: If you used the
          actual expense method, refer to the depreciation tables in Publication
          946 to calculate depreciation for the year of disposition, adjusting
          for any applicable conventions (e.g., half-year or mid-quarter).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Practical Example</h5>
      <p>
        Imagine you purchased a car for $25,500 in 2018 and used the standard
        mileage rate to calculate car expenses. Over the years, you accumulated
        a total depreciation deduction of $24,415. By the end of 2023, the
        adjusted basis of the car is $1,085. If you dispose of the car at this
        point, any sale price above $1,085 would potentially be subject to tax
        as a gain, largely as ordinary income due to depreciation recapture.
      </p>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Key Considerations</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Quarter of Disposal</span>: If disposing of
          the car within the recovery period using the actual expenses method,
          the depreciation deduction for the year of disposal must be adjusted
          based on the quarter in which the car is disposed, using percentages
          provided in Publication 946.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Depreciation Limits</span>: Ensure that the
          calculated depreciation does not exceed the limits set by the IRS,
          adjusting as necessary.

      <h2>Recordkeeping</h2>
      <p>
        Proper recordkeeping is essential for proving transportation expenses
        and staying ready to withstand scrutiny if necessary. To effectively
        prove your business expenses, you need to maintain timely and accurate
        records that can support each element of the expense. Document the cost
        of the car, the date you started using it for business, business
        mileage, and total annual mileage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold-font">Adequate records</span> include an account book,
        diary, log, trip sheet, or similar record, and must be kept in a written
        format. A computer record is considered written documentation.
      </p>
      <p class="ul-header">
        <span class="bold-font">Documentary evidence</span> generally includes
        receipts, canceled checks, bills, or similar documentation.
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>Amount of the expense</li>
        <li>Date the expense happened</li>
        <li>Place or location of the expense</li>
        <li>Purpose of the expense</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Exceptions to Documentary Evidence</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>Expenses under $75 except lodging</li>
        <li>
          Transportation expenses where a receipt is not readily available
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Timeliness and Accuracy</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Timely Recordkeeping</span>: The IRS places
          great value on records that are kept at or near the time the expense
          is incurred. A weekly log can be sufficient if it accurately reflects
          the entire week's expenses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Regular Updates</span>: Regular updates to
          your records help in maintaining their accuracy and relevance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font ul-header">Special Considerations</h5>
      <ul class="blog-toc">
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Confidential Information</span>: If your
          records include confidential information, ensure it's recorded in a
          secure and compliant manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Invoices and Bills</span>: Invoices and other
          forms of direct evidence can supplement your records, especially for
          ongoing business uses like deliveries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold-font">Destroyed Records</span>: In cases where
          records are destroyed due to circumstances beyond your control, such
          as natural disasters, you may reconstruct these records to
          substantiate your claims.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="bold-font">Record Retention</h5>
      <p>
        Keep your records for at least three years from the date you file your
        income tax return on which the deduction is claimed. For business use of
        a car, maintain records for each year of the recovery period.
