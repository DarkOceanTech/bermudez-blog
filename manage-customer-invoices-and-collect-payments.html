      <p class="blog-content">
        Accounting information can get out of date quickly. Except for annual
        information, most accounting information should be no more than 10-30
        days old. You should be able to access your up-to-date information and
        your CPA quickly and easily.

      <p class="blog-content">
        A proficient CPA makes it a habit to get back to clients as quickly as
        possible. Phone messages should be replied to the day they are left – or
        no later than the following day.

        Ideally the same person should work with you — not whoever is available
        at the time. That way a relationship can be built where the accountant
        and you are comfortable with each other.
