      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Arizona sales tax is known as
        <a
          href="https://azdor.gov/transaction-privilege-tax-tpt"
          target="_blank"
          class="text-links"
          >Transaction privilege tax (TPT)</a
        >. TPT is a tax on a vendor for the privilege of doing business in the
        state of Arizona. If your business sells products or provides services
        subject to TPT, you are responsible for paying the taxes on your
        applicable gross receipts. Authorization to do business and be able to
        pay the tax, requires a license administered by the

        <a href="https://azdor.gov/" target="_blank" class="text-links"
          >Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR)</a
        >
        . ADOR collects the tax for the counties and cities. Tax rates vary
        depending on the type of business activity, the city, and the county.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tax payments required by TPT may be passed on to your customer. An

        , must be provided to your vendors which allows them to defer the
        responsibility of the sales tax to your business. It is now your
        responsibility to manage the sales taxes and remain in compliance with
        state and local laws. Not staying in compliance may lead to penalties
        and interest charges.

      <h2>Economic Nexus</h2>
      <p>
        In Latin, <span class="italics">nexus</span> nexus means "to bind or
        tie." Nexus describes the connection a business has to Arizona. It
        decides whether the state has the authority to require your business to
        file and pay TPT.

          >Arizona nexus</a
        >
        is triggered when your business has a physical presence in the state or
        a <span class="italics">virtual</span> connection to the state such as
        out-of-state sellers.

        ADOR will require information about your business (including but not
        limited to):
      </p>
      <ul class="blog-toc">

      <h2>File and Pay your Liability</h2>

      <p>
        Remember that TPT is a two-step process. You must first file a return to
        notify ADOR of the current period's tax liability and then you must pay
        the liability.
